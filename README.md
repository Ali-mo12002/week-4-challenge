# Quiz App

This is a quiz application that tests your knowledge on football. It presents a series of multiple-choice questions and calculates your score based on the number of correct answers and the time taken to complete the quiz. so if you took 30 seconds to complete the quiz and you got 3 questions right you would get a score of 180. this is because you get two points for each question you get right so if you got 3 right you'd have 6 points.
